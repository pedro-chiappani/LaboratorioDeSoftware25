## Description
This project is a Java application that simulates a horse race using a terminal representation.
This project is also a Java application that simulates a horse race using Swing for the graphical user interface. 
It utilizes object-oriented programming principles to represent horses, races, and the race track. 
The application allows users to start the race, change horse breeds, and track each horse's performance during the race.

## Features
Terminal:
- Simulates a horse race with terminal.
- Allows users to choose the horses name and replay rounds multiple times
GUI
- Simulates a horse race with graphical representation.
- Allows users to start the race and track horse performance.
- Supports customization of horse breeds.
  
### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans)

## Installation

- Ensure all files are in the same folder, including all the horse frames and backgrounds.
  
## Running the program
- Open terminal change directory to game folder
- Call java Race.java for terminal representation
- Call java MainGUI.java for GUI simulation
Alternatively:
- Open an IDE, build and run Race.java for terminal representation.
- Open an IDE, build and run MainGUI.java for the GUI simulation.

## Usage
